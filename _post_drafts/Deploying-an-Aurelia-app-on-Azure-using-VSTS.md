In my [previous post](/blog/2017/08/22/Hosting-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure/),
I explained how to host an Aurelia application on Azure for very cheap.

In this post, I'll explain how to use 
[Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}
(VSTS) to easily deploy a static website or SPA application to Azure.

We'll start by automating the creation of our Azure infrastructure using 
an Azure Resource Manager template, then we'll script our Azure Functions 
proxy app. Lastly, we'll create a build definition and a release definition in 
VSTS to automate the whole deployment process.

> You'll need a [VSTS account](https://www.visualstudio.com/fr/team-services/){:target="_blank"} to
follow the third part of this post.

> You can get the sample Aurelia app I used for this post 
[here](https://github.com/manuel-guilbault/blog-post-aurelia-azure/releases/tag/2017-12-01-Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS){:target="_blank"}.
Additionally, this repository contains some files used for deployment on Azure
in the `azure` directory. More on this later.

## The Azure Resource Manager template

We can imagine that this application is part of a larger system. In such a
context, we probably would want to deploy this system on
additional environments such as development, staging, integration, and so on.
However, in the previous post, I created the Azure infrastructure manually
using the Azure portal. It makes our infrastructure unreplicable, and makes
creating those other environments tedious and error-prone.

Azure offers a piece of technology called Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
An ARM template is a JSON file that describes a set of Azure resources to 
deploy, along with how they depend on each other, so they can be deployed
in the right order. Additionally, if a given Azure resource already exists,
the ARM API is intelligent enough to simply update it so it matches the new
definition. Thanks to this, a stateful resource such as a Blob storage or a
SQL database won't lose its state.

We'll start by creating an ARM template to define the whole Azure
infrastructure we manually created in the previous post.

First, we'll create an `azure` directory in our Aurelia application, in
which we'll create the following `azuredeploy.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
  },
  "variables": {
  },
  "resources": [
  ],
  "outputs": {
  }
}
```

This is the standard ARM template skeleton. A template can have input `parameters`,
and can define `variables`. Of course, it is pretty useless if it doesn't define
some `resources`. Finally, it can export some `outputs`.

In addition to this structure, a template can use a rich expression syntax to
access resources' properties, compute values from other, or access variables or
parameters. You can get more familiar with ARM templates by checking the
[official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authoring-templates){:target="_blank"}.

### The parameters

Let's add the following `parameters`:

* `appName`: the name of the Azure Function app service. It must be globally unique,
  as it will be used in the web app's domain name. This parameter will be optional,
  as its default value will be generated by the template.
* `storageAccountName`: the name of the Storage account that will store the application's files.
  It must be globally unique. This parameter will be optional, as its default value will be 
  generated by the template.
* `storageAccountType`: the replication type of Blob Storage account. This parameter
  will be optional, as its default value will be `Standard_LRS` (see
  *[locally redundant storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction){:target="_blank"}*).
* `blobContainerName`: the name of the Blob Storage container in which our Aurelia
  application files will be stored. This parameter will be optional, as its default value
  will be `web-app-content`.

To add those parameters, simply replace the `parameters` object with the following:

```json
{
  "appName": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "[uniquestring('manuelguilbault.com', 'aurelia-azure', resourceGroup().id, 'webapp')]",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The name of your proxy webapp."
    }
  },
  "storageAccountName": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "[uniquestring('manuelguilbault.com', 'aurelia-azure', resourceGroup().id, 'storage')]",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The name of the Storage account."
    }
  },
  "storageAccountType": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
    "allowedValues": [
      "Standard_LRS",
      "Standard_GRS",
      "Standard_RAGRS"
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The type of Storage account"
    }
  },
  "blobContainerName": {
    "type": "string",
    "defaultValue": "web-app-content",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The name of the blob container where the web app is stored."
    }
  }
}
```

> It is important to note that the `uniquestring` function used to generate the default 
value of the `appName` and the `storageAccountName` parameters computes a deterministic 
value based on its arguments. Since App Service and Storage account names must be globally 
unique on Azure, you'll most certainly need to change the set of arguments passed to 
those `uniquestring` calls if you want to deploy this template.

### The variables

Next, let's use those parameters and define some variables that we'll use
in the description of the resources we wish to deploy:

```json
{
  "functionAppName": "[parameters('appName')]",
  "hostingPlanName": "[parameters('appName')]",
  "storageAccountName": "[parameters('storageAccountName')]",
  "storageAccountType": "[parameters('storageAccountType')]",
  "blobContainerName": "[parameters('blobContainerName')]"
}
```

Simply replace the `variables` object with the previous snippet in the template.

> As a rule of thumb, I always assign the `parameters` to `variables`, so the `resources`
declarations never directly use any parameter, but only variables. This makes the template easier
to change, as you can easily add or remove parameters and change how a variable's
value is computed without having to change multiple resource declarations.

### The resources

Our template will declare 3 different resources: a Storage account, a hosting plan, and a functions app.
Let's see how this looks like:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
    "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
    "apiVersion": "2017-06-01",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "kind": "Storage",
    "sku": {
      "name": "[variables('storageAccountType')]"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
    "apiVersion": "2015-04-01",
    "name": "[variables('hostingPlanName')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
      "name": "[variables('hostingPlanName')]",
      "computeMode": "Dynamic",
      "sku": "Dynamic"
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
    "apiVersion": "2015-08-01",
    "name": "[variables('functionAppName')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "kind": "functionapp",
    "dependsOn": [
      "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('hostingPlanName'))]",
      "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageAccountName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
      "serverFarmId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('hostingPlanName'))]",
      "siteConfig": {
        "appSettings": [
          {
            "name": "AzureWebJobsDashboard",
            "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageAccountName')), providers('Microsoft.Storage', 'storageAccounts').apiVersions[0]).keys[0].value)]"
          },
          {
            "name": "AzureWebJobsStorage",
            "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=', listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageAccountName')), providers('Microsoft.Storage', 'storageAccounts').apiVersions[0]).keys[0].value)]"
          },
          {
            "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING",
            "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=', listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('storageAccountName')), providers('Microsoft.Storage', 'storageAccounts').apiVersions[0]).keys[0].value)]"
          },
          {
            "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE",
            "value": "[toLower(variables('functionAppName'))]"
          },
          {
            "name": "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION",
            "value": "~1"
          },
          {
            "metadata": {
              "comment": "This will enable proxy functions. See https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues/356"
            },
            "name": "ROUTING_EXTENSION_VERSION",
            "value": "~0.2"
          },
          {
            "name": "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION",
            "value": "6.5.0"
          },
          {
            "name": "Storage.HostAndContainer",
            "value": "[concat(variables('storageAccountName'), '.blob.core.windows.net/', variables('blobContainerName'))]"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

The first object in the array describes the Storage account, and the second the hosting plan. Here, the
hosting plan uses the `Dynamic` SKU, so the pricing is calculated based on the consumption.

The third object describes the Functions app acting as a proxy in front of the Storage container. It contains
a couple of interesting details:

* The `dependsOn` array contains the ID of the first and second resources. This is to make sure that the
  web app is provisioned only once the Storage account and the hosting plan have been deployed.
* The `appSettings` array contains all the application settings that are either static values or that
  are known in the scope of the ARM template.

You can simply replace the value of the `resources` property in the template with the previous snippet.

### The outputs

Depending on which parameters are specified when the template is executed, some resource names may be
generated by the template. However, some of those names may be required by the release pipeline. As such,
we'll output those names, so the release pipeline can gather them up after the template is deployed and
use them in further release steps:

```json
{
  "AppService.Name": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "[variables('functionAppName')]"
  },
  "Storage.Account.Name": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "[variables('storageAccountName')]"
  },
  "Storage.Container.Name": {
    "type": "string",
    "value": "[variables('blobContainerName')]"
  }
}
```

Just replace the value of the `outputs` property in the template with the previous snippet.

## The Azure Functions app

In the previous post, we created the Azure Functions proxy app manually through the Azure portal.
In order to make our deployment automatic and replicable, we need to script our proxy app.

In your Aurelia app root directory, create the following file structure:

```
azure
└── functions-app
    ├── host.json
    └── proxies.json
```

In `functions-app/host.json`, just put an empty JSON object:

```json
{}
```

In `functions-app/proxies.json`, put the following:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/proxies",
  "proxies": {
      "default": {
          "matchCondition": {
              "route": "/{*path}"
          },
          "backendUri": "https://%Storage.HostAndContainer%/{path}%Storage.SasToken%"
      },
      "root": {
          "matchCondition": {
              "route": "/"
          },
          "backendUri": "https://%Storage.HostAndContainer%/index.html%Storage.SasToken%"
      }
  }
}
```

This will have the exact same result as what we did using the Azure portal in the previous post.

## Visual Studio Team Services

Now that we have an ARM template ready, we can start creating our build and release pipelines in VSTS.

If you're not familiar with VSTS, let's just say that it supports two different types of pipelines:
builds and releases. A build pipeline's job is to process some source code and to create one or more
build artifacts out of it. A release pipeline's job is to take one or more build artifacts and to
deploy them to a hosting environment. In our case, this hosting environment will be Azure.

Build and release pipelines are made of tasks. A task has a set of settings, based on its type, and
variables can be used in those settings. A variable is accessed using the `$(variable_name)` notation.
You'll see examples of this later.

> For the following part, you'll need to host your Aurelia app along with the `azure` directory
containing the ARM template and the Functions proxy app on a Git repository. VSTS supports a couple
of different providers, such as GitHub or Bitbucket. However, unless you already created a Git
repository somewhere else, the simplest solution is to create a Git repository on VSTS and to push
your code there.

> If you never did it before, you'll need to authorize VSTS to deploy on your Azure 
subscription. You can follow [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2015/10/04/automating-azure-resource-group-deployment-using-a-service-principal-in-visual-studio-online-buildrelease-management/){:target="_blank"}.

### The build pipeline

A build pipeline is a sequence of tasks, which should publish one or more build artifacts.

#### Creating the build definition

In VSTS, go to `Build and Release`, then `Builds`, then `New`. You'll be asked to choose a template.
Just select `Empty process`.

VSTS will show the following screen, where the `Process` tab is selected in the left panel:

[![Create Build pipeline, Process step](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Build-Process-Step.png)](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Build-Process-Step.png){:target="_blank"}

First, give a name to your build pipeline and select the `Hosted` agent queue.
Then, click on the `Get sources` tab in the left panel. You'll see the following screen:

[![Create Build pipeline, Get Sources step](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Build-Get-Sources-Step.png)](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Build-Get-Sources-Step.png){:target="_blank"}

Here, select the repository from which your code will be fetched.

#### Adding the tasks

Next, we'll add tasks to our build pipeline. Clicking the `+` button sitting beside the `Phase 1`
tab in the left panel will display the task list screen. You can browse the available tasks,
or use the search bar. After you find the task you want to add, you just have to click its `Add` 
button, and the task will appear in the left panel. You can then select the task in the left 
panel and its configuration form will show up in the right panel.

Here's the list of tasks, along with their respective properties, to add to the build pipeline.
The order must be respected. Any property not listed here should be left with its default value.

| Task type | Property | Value |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| **npm** | Command | custom |
| | Command and arguments | install -g aurelia-cli |
| **npm** | Command | install |
| **Command Line** | Tool | au |
| | Arguments | build \-\-env prod |
| **Copy Files** | Source Folder | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory) |
| | Contents | scripts/\*\*/\*<br/>favicon.ico<br/>index.html |
| | Target Folder | $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) |
| **Publish Build Artifacts** | Path to publish | $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) |
| | Artifact name | drop |
| **Delete Files** | Source Folder | $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) |
| | Contents | \*\* |
| **Copy Files** | Source Folder | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory) |
| | Contents | azure/\*\*/\* |
| | Target Folder | $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) |
| **Publish Build Artifacts** | Path to publish | $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) |
| | Artifact name | azure |

Once you are done adding the list of tasks, click the `Save` button.

To summarize, this pipeline will first install the Aurelia CLI, then will restore the application's
dependencies and transpile and bundle the app. Next, it will create two artifacts: a first one named
`drop`, which will contain the application's files, and a second named `deploy`, which will contain
the ARM template and other scripts that our release pipeline will use.

### The release pipeline

The release pipeline is linked to a source of build artifacts, and is made of one or more environments,
which can be connected together in sequence or in parallel. Each environment is a sequence of tasks,
just like a build pipeline.

#### Installing VSTS extensions

To make our release pipeline as simple as possible, we'll install two extensions from the 
[VSTS marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=app%20settings%20arm%20outputs&target=vsts&category=Build%20and%20release&sortBy=Relevance){:target="_blank"}: 
[ARM Outputs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=keesschollaart.arm-outputs){:target="_blank"} and 
[Azure App Service: Set App settings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hboelman.AzureAppServiceSetAppSettings){:target="_blank"}. The first extension will add a release task that
retrieves the output of an ARM template deployment and exposes them as VSTS variables, making them available
to the next tasks in the sequence. The second extension will add a release task allowing to update
the App settings of an App Service in Azure. Those two extensions are free and open source.

#### Creating the release definition

Once this is done, go to `Build and Release`, then `Releases`, click on `Create release definition` and select
`Empty process`. VSTS will ask you to create a first environment:

[![Create Release pipeline, create environment step](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Create-Environment.png)](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Create-Environment.png){:target="_blank"}

For the sake of this post, let's just create a single `production` environment, so go ahead and change the
name of the default environment.

#### Linking the build artifact

Next, let's link our release pipeline to our build pipeline. Click on `Add artifact` and fill the fields as follows:

[![Create Release pipeline, add artifact step](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Add-Artifact.png)](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Add-Artifact.png){:target="_blank"}

Here, you should select the proper VSTS project in the Project field, and your new build definition in the
Source field. You can leave the other fields to their default values.

Next, let's enable continuous deployment by clicking on the lightning icon on the top right corner of the new 
linked artifact and by enabling continuous deployment:

[![Create Release pipeline, enable continuous deployment](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Enable-Continuous-Deployment.png)](/images/posts/Deploying-an-Aurelia-app-on-Azure-using-VSTS/Create-Release-Enable-Continuous-Deployment.png){:target="_blank"}

Thanks to this, every time a new build is completed successfully, the release pipeline will be triggered automatically.

#### Adding variables

Next, let's create two variables to make our release pipeline easier to maintain. Select the `Variables` tab,
then `Process variables`, and `Add` the two following rows:

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| AppService.Name | *The unique name for your application. This will be the subdomaine of `azurewebsites.net` used to access to your app. For example, I put `manuelguilbault-blog-post-aurelia-azure` here, so the URL to my app is `http://manuelguilbault-blog-post-aurelia-azure.azurewebsites.net`* |
| ResourceGroup.Name | *The name of the resource group on which the application's resources will be deployed. I used `blog-post-aurelia-azure-production` here.* |
| BuildArtifact.Name | *The name of the build pipeline to which our release pipeline is linked. Here I used `post-azure-aurelia`.* |

Then, click `Save`.

#### Creating an environment

Lastly, let's create the task sequence for our `production` environment. Go back to `Pipeline` and
click on the `1 phase, 0 task` link in the `production` environment box. VSTS will show a screen 
that is very similar to the one we used to add tasks to our build pipeline. It works the same way.
Here's the sequence of tasks, along with their properties, to add to the release pipeline:

| Task type | Property | Value |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| Azure Resource Group Deployment | Azure subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | Resource group | $(ResourceGroup.Name) |
| | Location | *Select the location where you want to deploy your app* |
| | Template | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(BuildArtifact.Name)/deploy/azure/azuredeploy.json |
| | Override template parameters | -appName $(AppService.Name) |
| ARM Outputs | Azure Connection Type | Azure Resource Manager |
| | AzureRM Subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | Resource Group | $(ResourceGroup.Name) |
| | Outputs to process | Storage.Account.Name, Storage.Container.Name |
| Azure File Copy | Source | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(BuildArtifact.Name)/drop/ |
| | Azure Connection Type | Azure Resource Manager |
| | Azure Subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | Destination Type | Azure Blob |
| | RM Storage Account | $(Storage.Account.Name) |
| | Container Name | $(Storage.Container.Name) |
| | Additional Argumenta | /SetContentType |
| Azure PowerShell | Azure Connection Type | Azure Resource Manager |
| | Azure Subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | Script Type | Script File Path |
| | Script Path | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(BuildArtifact.Name)/deploy/azure/tools/generate-sas-token.ps1 |
| | Script Arguments | -ResourceGroup $(ResourceGroup.Name) -StorageAccount $(Storage.Account.Name) -StorageContainer $(Storage.Container.Name) -Permission r -ExportTo Storage.SasToken |
| Azure App Service Deploy | Azure Subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | App Service Name | $(AppService.Name) |
| | Package or folder | $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/$(BuildArtifact.Name)/deploy/azure/functions-app/ |
| Azure App Service: Set App settings | AzureRM Subscription | *Select your Azure subscription* |
| | Azure App Service | $(AppService.Name) |
| | Resource Group | $(ResourceGroup.Name) |
| | App Settings | Storage.SasToken='$(Storage.SasToken)' |

Once you are done adding the list of tasks, click the `Save` button.

To summarize, this pipeline will first provision the Azure resources using our ARM template. It will then
retrieve the template's outputs and add them as VSTS variables, so they are available to the next tasks.
After this, it copies the content of the `drop` artifact to the Blob Storage container, then generates
a long-lived SAS token so the proxy app has permission to read the Blob Storage container's content. This
generated SAS token is assigned to yet another VSTS variable. Lastly, the proxy app is deployed on the
Azure Functions App Service and its app settings are updated with the Storage container SAS token. At this
point, the application is fully deployed and ready to be used.

> You may have noticed that the ARM template deployment task overrides the `appName` parameter. This
is so the app's domain name is predetermined. However in some scenarios, such as if we add a custom
domain to the app, we could leave this parameter out and let the ARM template generate the app name.

#### Generating a Storage SAS token

You may have noticed that the fourth task expects a PowerShell script at `azure/tools/generate-sas-token.ps1`.
This script is called with the resource group, the Storage account name, and the Storage container
name as parameters. It is expected to generate a SAS token with read permissions on the Storage
container and to assign this token to the `Storage.SasToken` VSTS variable.

The content of this script is pretty straightforward:

```powershell
Param(
  [string] $ResourceGroup,
  [string] $StorageAccount,
  [string] $StorageContainer,
  [string] $Permission,
  [string] $ExportTo
)

$key = Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup -Name $StorageAccount
$context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccount -StorageAccountKey $key[0].Value
$sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Name $StorageContainer -Permission $Permission -Context $context -ExpiryTime (Get-Date).AddYears(100)
Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=$ExportTo]$sasToken"
```

The script starts by fetching the access keys for the Storage account, then it creates a context object for the
Storage account using the primary access key and creates a new SAS token, setting the expiration 100 years in
the future. Lastly, it writes a VSTS command to the standard output so the SAS token is assigned to a VSTS
variable whose name was passed as the `ExportTo` parameter.

> Don't forget to push this file to your Git repository.

### Building & releasing

Once your code is pushed, and the build and release pipelines are created, you can go back to
`Build and Release`, then `Builds`. If you move your mouse over the row of the build definition we
created earlier, you'll see a `...` button appear. Click on it, then click on `Queue new build` in the
contextual menu, and confirm the dialog that will show up by clicking on `Queue`.

Once the build is completed, you can go to `Releases`. A new release should start automatically if
you properly enabled continuous deployment earlier. Once the release completes, you can then go to
your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/){:target="_blank"} to make sure everything was deployed properly.

You can also fire up your favorite browser and navigate to `http://your_app_name.azurewebsites.net/`
to test your app running on Azure.

## Conclusion

VSTS, Azure and ARM templates are amazing pieces of technology. When used together, not only is hosting
an Aurelia application on Azure pretty cheap, but building and deploying it is fairly easy. 
Additionally, the build and release pipelines we created here can be enhanced to do much more.
For example, you can add a NPM task to run unit tests in your build pipeline.
Or you can
[add a custom domain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/templates/201-web-app-custom-domain/){:target="_blank"}
to the proxy app during release. If your app relies on the 
[aurelia-configuration plugin](https://github.com/Vheissu/aurelia-configuration){:target="_blank"},
you can [update your config.json file](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geeklearningio.gl-vsts-tasks-file-patch){:target="_blank"} using VSTS variables just like we do with the
App Service's app settings. There are lots of extensions to perform various tasks and, when you really 
can't find what you need, the Azure PowerShell API is [pretty well documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview){:target="_blank"}.

## What's next?

If your Aurelia application uses the router in push state mode, you may have noticed that the current
solution doesn't support deep linking. In the next post, we'll address this problem.

In a further post, we'll see how to add a custom domain to our app. We'll also see how to integrate the
[Let's Encrypt Azure site extension](https://github.com/sjkp/letsencrypt-siteextension){:target="_blank"} with our
Azure Functions app, so we can enable HTTPS by generating an SSL certificate for free using
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/){:target="_blank"}.
