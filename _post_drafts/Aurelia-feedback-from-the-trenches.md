I've been using [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/){:target="_blank"} to write multiple applications of 
various size for more than a year now, and I thought it might be interesting for some people to get 
some real-life feedback.

All in all, the framework is awesome. Aurelia's developer experience is much better than that of
other frameworks I've worked with (\**cough*\* Angular \**cough*\*). The framework is flexible, 
extensible, and very little intrusive. You don't have to fight it to do things the right way, whatever 
that right way is.

However, entropy is constantly at work, and things can quickly become messy if you don't pay attention.
Here are a few things I've learnt along the way.

## Type everything

If you don't use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/){:target="_blank"} yet, you really should.
Its type system adds tremedous value when compared to plain JS.

### Why?

First, it serves as API documentation for the developers working on your code base. Let's imagine the 
following JS code snippet:

```js
export class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}

function getFullName(user) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
}
```

Check the `getFullName` function. What is the expected type of this `user` parameter? Is it an object or 
something else? What are its properties and methods? Here, we can probably guess that it is a `User` 
instance. However, if the class and the function live in distinct files or directories, good luck with that.

Exploring such a JS code base can be a nightmare, as you would need to search for calls to `getFullName` 
to try to figure out what parameters are passed to it. The type system makes understanding existing code
much easier:

```ts
function getFullName(user: User) {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
}
```

It is now pretty clear that the `user` argument is an instance of the `User` class.

The type system also prevents a whole class of bugs, where some part of the code uses something -
a variable, method, function, or parameter - the wrong way. In plain JS, such bugs must be
covered by unit tests. In TypeScript, the transpiler will complain about such a misuse if things are properly
typed. The type system can completely replace a whole category of unit tests.

Let's imagine the following code:
```typescript
export class User {
  constructor(public firstName: string, public lastName: string) {}
}

function getFullName(user: User) {
  return `${user.firstname} ${user.lastname}`;
}
```

This code has a bug. The `getFullName` function contains typos: it uses the `firstname` and `lastname`
properties, while the `User` class defines those properties using a capital `N`: `firstName` and
`lastName`.

Here, the error is easy to spot, as the class definition and the function sit side by side. However,
if they live in distinct files, such a bug can be hard to spot without either a unit test or the 
TypeScript transpiler. Relying on the type system for such things is much simpler and quicker than 
writing unit tests.

### Everything, really?

Yes. Everything. For examples:

* Create an interface for the route parameters passed to the `activate` method of a route component,
* Specify the type of the `@bindable` properties of a custom element,
* Use typed events published through the `EventAggregator`,
* Use classes or interfaces for objects fetched using the `fetch` client,
* Didn't I say everything?

By typing everything, you eliminate a whole category of bugs. Additionally, you add documentation
for other developers and your future self. Lastly, you give more informations to your tools
(auto-completers, linters, bundlers, etc.) so they can do a better job assisting you.

Those advantages largely outweight the additional cost of properly typing things, trust me.
Or don't, and try it for yourself. You'll see.

## Small apps over big apps

Whenever possible, it is best to write multiple small applications over writing one huge application.
A small code base is more manageable than a large one, and it's easier to have multiple small teams 
maintaining multiple small applications than one huge team working on a single huge code base.
Small applications can be released independently and at different paces, while releasing huge apps
require much more planification and coordination between team members, and such a process is much less
agile.

I didn't invent anything here; microservices have been around long enough now, and they are based on the
same principles.

## Bundle intelligently

If you can't keep your application small as suggested before, at least use bundles intelligently so your 
application loads faster.

For example, if your application's users are segregated in roles, you can group features 
in role-based bundles. This way, a given user would load only the bundle(s) he needs to do his job
based on its role(s).

## Organize by features

Aurelia [features](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/app-configuration-and-startup/6){:target="_blank"}
are extremely useful to organize your code.

For example, I often have a `validation` feature in my Aurelia applications. This feature handles
some simple tasks related to form validation:

* It loads the 
  [`aurelia-validation`](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/validation/latest/validation-basics){:target="_blank"}
  plugin,
* It registers at least one 
  [`ValidationRenderer`](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/validation/latest/validation-basics/7){:target="_blank"}
  in the DI container,
* It registers any
  [custom validation rules](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/validation/latest/validation-basics/10){:target="_blank"}
  needed across the application.

Features can also be used to group components, models, and services related to specific domains.

A chapter of [my book](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-aurelia){:target="_blank"} is 
dedicated to this subject.

## Decompose

A route component fetching data from an HTTP endpoint and rendering a complex view all by itself will
likely be hard to maintain, as it has too many responsibilities. It also makes it hard - or even impossible -
to reuse parts of its behavior or UI elements.

Components should be **loosely coupled** and **highly cohesive**. They should be small and solve a 
well-defined problem. Larger components should be composed of smaller ones, and their task should be
to configure and coordinate interactions between their constituents.

A lot of Aurelia's features can be of great help in decomposing components and making them flexible
enough to be used in larger components: one-way and two-way data-binding, event aggregation,
content projection, and template injection, are the cornerstones of well-taylored components. Make
sure you master each of those techniques well enough, so you can make enlightened design decisions.

## Separate UI & domain concerns

Similarly, keeping UI and domain artifacts separated in your code base will make it easier
to maintain.

By **UI artifact**, I mean:

* Components,
* Custom elements & attributes,
* Value converters,
* Binding behaviors,
* Templates.

By **Domain artifact**, I mean:

* Domain models,
* Domain services,
* HTTP clients.

For example, a route component should be built by composing UI and domain artifacts together.
If it fetches its own data from an HTTP endpoint, defines its own view model for this data and has a complex
template to present this data to the user, it will likely be hard to maintain and its constituents
impossible to reuse. Additionally, domain intelligence will be lost in UI concerns.

However, if you design distinct domain models and services, isolated from UI components, then
aggregate them all in a route component, this route component will be smaller because it will simply coordinate 
interactions between its domain and UI constituents. Plus, your code will likely be saner and easier to 
understand.

## Have fun!

I had a lot of fun in the last year working with Aurelia. I hope you do too!
