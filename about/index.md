I'm a lonesome Canadian lost in the Parisian jungle. I write code, design software & IT systems, coach teams, teach, speak, and write.
I put myself in the shoes of the customers and the users of every piece of software I work on - I'm a convinced practitioner of DDD.
I like learning new things, both on the technical and the domain side.

## **The software behind this blog**

My previous blog was on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/){:target="_blank"}. However, I wanted more control over the layout, the CSS, and more globally the features.
At this point, my collegue [Evrim Senturk](http://mechanicalobject.com/){:target="_blank"} showed me his brand new blog, and I just decided to bluntly copy his solution.
Thanks dude!
