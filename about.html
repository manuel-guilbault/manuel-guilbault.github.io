<p>
  I'm a lonesome Canadian lost in the Parisian jungle. I write code, design software & IT systems, 
  coach teams, teach, speak, and write. I put myself in the shoes of the customers and the users 
  of every piece of software I work on - I'm a convinced practitioner of DDD. I like learning new 
  things, both on the technical and the domain side.
